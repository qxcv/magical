The predicted goal, however, states to \"Maintain position with B1,\" which implies that block B1 should not be moved from its current position.\n\nSince the predicted goal suggests no movement for B1, while the ground truth goals require B1 to be moved to a specific location, the predicted goal would lead to a different outcome than the ground truth goals. Therefore, the similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
