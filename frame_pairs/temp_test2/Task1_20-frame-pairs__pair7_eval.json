The predicted goal, however, only mentions placing B1 on the left side of the arena, without specifying that it should be in the top left corner.\n\nThis difference is meaningful because the left side of the arena could include areas that are not the top left corner. Therefore, an agent following the predicted goal might place B1 somewhere on the left side but not necessarily in the correct location as specified by the ground truth goals.\n\nThe similarity level is:\n\n(1) Incorrect: An agent that tries to achieve the predicted goal will fail in achieving the real goal because there is a meaningful difference between the two goals.",
